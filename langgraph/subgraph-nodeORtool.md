# Question 1

Wait, are you sure? Subgraph shouldn't be invoked as nodes. Like, what are your thoughts on it? You just don't think of the subgraph as a tool that I need such that when I invoke subgraph, once the subgraph has a final result, it passes back to the main agent's conversation so that the main agent can carry on. That kind of thing.

You raise an important distinction! Let’s clarify the architecture and reasoning behind “subgraph as node” vs. “subgraph as tool,” and why, **for your requirements (having sub-agents with isolated context that are “called” by the main agent, then return a final result into the main agent’s workflow), the “subgraph as tool” pattern is actually the best fit.**

---

## 1. **LangGraph’s Intended Abstractions**

- **Subgraph as Node:**

  - You can attach a subgraph directly as a node in your main graph.
  - This is great if you want linear or branched flows, and have strict transitions—i.e., “After this step, always run the sub-agent, then merge state.”
  - It’s **not a “callable” primitive**; it’s deterministic in graph traversal and typically used for _always-on_ workflow steps, not “on-demand” invocations based on main agent reasoning.

- **Subgraph as Tool:**
  - Here, you explicitly wrap the subgraph’s logic so the main agent can “request” it much as it would call an API or calculator tool.
  - This means the **main agent has agency**: the LLM decides as part of its reasoning when (and how) to invoke a sub-agent, and what to do with the reply. This pattern matches real-world agent orchestration (e.g., “I tried a web search, now I’ll ask the calendar agent…”, etc.).
  - This decouples sub-agent execution from the main flow, letting the main agent (LLM) chain tool calls as it wants.

---

## 2. **Why “Subgraph as Tool” is Preferable for Your Use-case**

- **On-demand, LLM-directed sub-agent calls:**  
  The main agent can, from within its own reasoning, choose whether or not to invoke a sub-agent for a specific user query.
- **Encapsulated histories/context:**  
  The tool call launches a fresh context for the sub-agent, which is never exposed to the main agent except for the final output.
- **Composability and modularity:**  
  You can add or remove sub-agents without altering your main agent’s logic or its node/edge structure.
- **Matches OpenAI “function calling” mental model:**  
  The main agent calling a tool/subgraph as a “function/tool” is parallel to how multi-agent OpenAI flows are designed.

---

## 3. **What if I Used “Subgraph as Node”?**

- The subgraph runs as a workflow step, not as an agent-directed call.
- The main graph’s traversal logic—coded by you—dominates.  
  The main agent (LLM) won’t “decide” when to run the subgraph; **it simply always happens at a given point** in the workflow.
- This is less flexible for agentic composition (e.g., when user input/LLM reasoning should determine which sub-agent handles a subtask).

## 4. **Summary Table**

| Pattern          | LLM/Agent Decides When? | State/History Isolation  | “Tool-like” Result Handling         | Good for Modular Multi-agent |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Subgraph as Node | ❌ No (always-on step)  | ✅ (w/ input/output map) | ❌ (harder for agent to coordinate) | 😐 Sometimes                 |
| Subgraph as Tool | ✅ Yes (LLM chooses)    | ✅ (by design)           | ✅ (true tool return semantics)     | ✅ Ideal                     |

## 5. **Expert Systems Insight**

- The **subgraph-as-tool** pattern is how modular “skills,” “chains,” or “sub-agents” are implemented in mature agentic systems (LangChain, CrewAI, Microsoft AutoGen, etc.).
- This pattern preserves agent autotomy: your main agent can reason and route subtasks to sub-agents/tools, chains results, and continues as needed.

---

## 6. **Conclusion and Guidance**

**For any scenario where the main agent should choose—based on its reasoning or the user request—WHEN (and even WHICH) sub-agent to invoke, treat each sub-agent as a tool!**

- Wrap subgraph logic as a callable Python tool function/class.
- Register it with the LLM agent as a tool.
- When needed, the agent “calls” the tool, the subgraph does its multistep reasoning, and the final output is returned to the main agent’s context (just like a regular tool call).
- This keeps everything clean, isolated, extensible, and agentic.

# Question 2

But if these are exposed as tools, can the LangGraph Mermaid reflect them correctly? Okay, I'm just curious. What if the subgraphs are nodes - then how would they be different from the tools? Is it if they are nodes means they are deterministic, or how would it work?

Fantastic questions! Let’s break these down so you can really “see” how your architectural choice is reflected in both **LangGraph’s Mermaid graph** and in practical system behavior.

---

## 1. **If Subgraphs Are Exposed as Tools:**

- **Tools are NOT Nodes in the Mermaid/LangGraph diagram.**
  - Tools are typically invoked within special “tools” nodes (like the ToolNode in LangGraph) or as part of an agent’s decision process.
  - **If you wrap a subgraph as a tool** (e.g., @tool def my_subagent(): ...), you won’t see the inner steps of that tool/sub-agent’s logic in the **main** graph’s Mermaid diagram. You’ll just see “tools” as a node or edge.
  - The subgraph’s internal logic/steps **are not expanded visually**—it’s a black box as far as the higher-level graph is concerned.
  - In short, in the main graph rendering, the tool is just a “capability” the agent has, not a node or subgraph.

---

## 2. **If Subgraphs Are Added as Nodes:**

- **Nodes and Subgraphs ARE Visible in the Mermaid Main Graph.**
  - When you add a subgraph as a node (`builder.add_node("my_sub", my_subgraph, input_map=..., output_map=...)`), the Mermaid graph will reflect the presence of this subgraph as a node.
  - Some visualizers can drill down to render the internal nodes/edges of the subgraph, though the default is to render it as a labeled node.
  - The flow (START → ... → subgraph_node → ...) is explicit and visible.
  - This makes execution deterministic: the subgraph will always run at a certain point in the pipeline, and will always pass state back as defined by mappings.
  - In composite diagrams, sometimes subgraph internals can be expanded for visualization, but this is implementation-specific (not always shown in vanilla Mermaid exports).

---

## 3. **Difference in Semantics: Tool vs Node (Subgraph)**

| Aspect                  | Tool (Wrapped subgraph)                              | Node (Subgraph as node)                                       |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shown in Mermaid?       | **No** (Just a “tools” node, not subgraph internals) | **Yes** (“subgraph” node is explicit; may show internal flow) |
| Execution               | **On demand** (agent/LLM decides, by reasoning)      | **Deterministic** (runs whenever graph reaches that node)     |
| Modularity              | High (easy to add/remove; opaque to graph)           | High (but statically defined in the graph)                    |
| Visibility of internals | No (opaque black box to main agent)                  | Yes (could be expanded/inspected at graph level)              |
| Observability           | Seen as tool call step (not graph traversal)         | Seen as workflow step (parent/child graph trace possible)     |
| Use-case                | Agentic systems, function/tool call APIs             | Pipelines, business logic, static workflows                   |

---

## 4. **Summary: When to Use Which**

- **Use Subgraph as Tool:**  
   When you want something to be “callable” by agent reasoning, not always-on. Clean modularity but not visualized as a workflow node.
- **Use Subgraph as Node:**  
   When you want deterministic, always-run integration—think part of a stepwise workflow.

---

## 5. **Advanced Visualization**

- For complex debugging, you can generate **separate** Mermaid graphs for subgraphs and main graph.
- When using observability tools (like LangSmith), both patterns appear, but tools show up as tool calls (including sub-agent tool calls), and nodes show up as workflow branches.

---

### **TL;DR**

- **Tools** do NOT show subgraph details in Mermaid; they are invoked on demand, controlled by the LLM/agent.
- **Subgraphs as nodes** ARE shown as workflow steps in Mermaid, and always executed as part of that workflow path—they act like always-on “macro steps” in your flow.

If you want the ability to “see” all agent flows in your main graph diagram, use subgraphs as nodes.  
If you care most about flexible, agent-directed delegation and don’t need the workflow to deterministically execute every sub-agent, use the tool-wrapping pattern.
